There's a crazy amount of TUI projects out there, and we can't list them all (though we try!)

For more, see awesome-opensource's [TUI Projects](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/tui) page.

Looking for lightweight but not necessarily TUI? check out mayfrost's [alternatives list](https://github.com/mayfrost/guides/blob/master/ALTERNATIVES.md)!

Enjoy Vim keybinds and don't want to learn new ones? check out the [Big Pile of Vim-like](https://vim.reversed.top)

First-hand reviews for a lot of these tools and many, many more at k.mandla's [Inconsolation blog](https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/index/). The site also has a "surprise me with a random tool" link!
